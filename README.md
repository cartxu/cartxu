<h2>Hello, world! 👋 </h2>

<p>My name is <strong>Carmen Navarro</strong>, I am 33 years old and I live in <strong>Madrid, Spain.</strong> <p>
  
<p>I started learning web development during 2020's quarentine because I needed a change in my life, and this is something I have <strong>always wanted to do</strong>. I mean... I even started studying computer engineering when I was 18, but, I was young and *stupid* and life brought me throught a different path, I don't regret it because I have learnt A LOT since then, thanks to that choices I made. 
  
During 2020, I stopped working due to the pandemic and I decided I have to do something to take the path I have always wanted to walk, the time had come for me. 

So here I am. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my projects for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning React, Python and Django.
- ⭐ Always perfectioning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 👾 I love Bootstrap and Sass.
- 🧘🏼‍♀️ I am a yogui.
- 🐮 Animal and Planet Earth lover.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've never thought I would love programming so much!
