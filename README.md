<h2>Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

<p>My name is <strong>Carmen Navarro</strong>, I am 33 years old and I live in <strong>Madrid, Spain.</strong> <p>
  
<p>I started learning web development during 2020's quarentine because I NEEDED a change in my life, and this is something I have <strong>always wanted to do</strong>. I mean... I even started studying computer engineering when I was 18, but, I was young and stupid and life brought me throught a different path, I don't regret it because I have learnt A LOT since then, thanks to that choices I made. 
  
During 2020, I stopped working for awhile due to the pandemic and I decided I have to do something to take the path I have always wanted to walk, the time had come for me. 

So here I am. 

Working hard to domain HTML, CSS and Javascript and learning Python, React, Vue, Angular... and hoping all this may be part of my work someday!

Nice to meet you! see you around :) </p>
